# :robot: 3.9.0 - Utilizing Logic Gates

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

Logic gate integrated circuits allow us to make electronic devices that respond to inputs.  In this final lab of the unit we will employ the 74 series integrated circuit chip to demonstrate mathematical logic may be used to solve problems and utilize the NAND or NOR gate to build other logic gates. üöÄ

## The 74 Series IC Chip

The 74 series IC chip is widely available and inexpensive.  Like most consumer electronics, it has a temperature tolerance of above 0¬∞ C.  For more robust applications, more expensive, military grade, chips are available in the 54 series.  They also fit on the solderless breadboard nicely.  To begin, we will work with the 74x00 chip which includes four NAND gates.  You will then select another gate from our lab selection and build a second circuit.  Finally, we will demonstrate the versatility of the NAND or NOR gates by building a third circuit and using them as universal gates.

Refer to [this list from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits#74x00_%E2%80%93_74x99) to find the data sheet for the ICs you use in this lab.  Be sure to reference the correct sheet in your final reflections.

## üìù Next steps

Your submission will include a markdown file titled, "results.md" and two text files titled, "my_logic_circuit.txt" and "universal_gate_circuit.txt".  You will include descriptions of what you did as well as videos showing each step working.

### Build the NAND Gate Circuit

1. Open the text file named, "NAND_circuit.txt" in the Circuit Simulator App.
2. Build the circuit.
3. In your results file, describe what the NAND gate is doing (from a logical math perspective) and include a video showing your working prototype.

### Build Another Circuit of Your Choice

1. Choose another 74 series IC ship from those available in the lab.  Be sure you look it up before using it so you understand how the pins are set up and which logical functions it utilizes.
2. Build a circuit that visually shows how your logic gate works (as in the previous example).
3. Build your circuit on the Circuit Simulator App and save it in this repository as "my_logic_circuit.txt".
4. Describe what your circuit does in your "results.md" file and include a video of the prototype working.

### Utilize the Universal Logic Gates

1. Going back to our NAND gate now (or grab a NOR gate chip if you prefer), design a circuit which demonstrates how either of these universal gates may be used to build another.  Refer to [this section of the Wikipedia page on Logic Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate#Universal_logic_gates) to help you decide what you are doing.  You will be assigned a gate to build with a NAND or NOR chip.
2. Build the circuit that demonstrates the logic gate working.
3. Build your circuit on the Circuit Simulator App and save it in this repository as "universal_gate_circuit.txt".
4. Describe what your new circuit does in your "results.md" file and include a video of the prototype working.
